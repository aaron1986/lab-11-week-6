## Overview

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
 This application has the purpose of allowing a user to store a reading list of books. To make use of the list the user needs to be able to access the list of books and access information about individual books. To maintain the list the user needs to be able to edit information about existing books, mark them as read, add new books and remove ones that are no longer wanted. In addition for privacy and to prevent vandalism access should be restricted to authorised users.


## Getting Started

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

	- Set up the Can Of Books project folder.
	- Create the client folder and app under the Can Of Books folder with npm create vite@latest.
	- Create a server folder under Can Of Books with a server.js file inside it.
	- Write this boilerplate code in server.js:
	
				const express = require("express");
				const cors = require("cors");
				require("dotenv").config();
				const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;
				const app = express();
				app.use(cors());

				// add endpoints here

				app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`App is running PORT ${PORT}`));
				
	- Create a package.json file under Can Of Books with npm init -y
	- Install libraries with npm i express cors dotenv axios mongoose
	- Use np i react-router-dom to install react router dom
	- Optionally install nodemon with npi i nodemon
	- Add .env files to the client and server folders
	- Add .env to the .gitignore file
	- Make the project folder a repository with git init
	- Link the local and remote repos with git remote add origin <project name>
	- The project is now ready for coding.


## Architecture

<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

The application has a client-server structure with the client handling the user interface and presention and the server handling the book database and processing queries to it. The code is written in Javacript and Node.js within a html framework and CSS styling and Express provides a server. The project is stored in a mono repository on Github with client and server folders. VS Code and Vite are employed for development. The client and server are deployed to the web on separate servers, on Vercel and Render respectively. The book list is implemented in MongoDB, a freely available noSQL database.
